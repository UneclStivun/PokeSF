	On this website you can create and configurate pokemon. An admin will validate this pokemon and add it to the database, if it is compliant to battles (i.e. not overpowered due to all attributes maxed out). <br>
	You can also search for certain similarities in the database by filling values that are of interest for you. <br>
	The resulting similarities can be added to a quicklist. The quicklist helps you to add pokemon to a pokemon team. Of course you can also do it without the quicklist. <br>
	A pokemon team must contain six members. A team of six pokemon can be named and saved. Only already validated pokemon can be saved in a team!<br>
	You can continue or skip the team creation. Before you can start a pokemon fight against an AI you have to select a pokemon team. If you saved your team, you can choose it.<br>
	You can assign a team to yourself and the enemy team. By choosing a team you will be shown the types, your team is weak or immune against. After assigning two team you can start the fight. <br>
	<br>
	The fight is round based. You can switch through your pokemon, but the enemy can still attack. You can choose an attack presented by buttons. You can hover over certain elemts to get more information.<br>
	The buttons will show what kind of attack they will do and what type it has. Hovering over the pokemon names will show you their types.<br>
	in the explanation box you can see what actions happened in the round. Attacks show <u>Explanation</u> which can also be hovered. Explanations contain what aspects were included in the calculation of the damage.<br>
	You always can end the fight and choose a new team.
	
	<br><br>
	To do so, you have do register. <br>
	Visiting the main page and reading this manual is for free :)
